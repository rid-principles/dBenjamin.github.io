        <h2>Feature 1: Detecting and flagging files containg PII (Personal Identifiable Information)</h2>
        <p>This feature uses the grep command to check each file with the employeeList file containing all the SSN's of all the employees in the company.</p>

    <!-- Feature 2 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Feature 2: Detecting Duplicates and allowing user to choose whether to flag them or not</h2>
        <p>This feature uses the diff command to check each file with one another to determine whether they are dulplicates or not which is a strong indicator that the email was forwarded.</p>

    <!-- Feature 3 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Feature 3: Allowing user to view the list of flagged files in a report</h2>
        <p>This feature combines the output of the first two parts of the script to make a printed flaggedList report at the end of the script.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Feature 4: Creating a file containing all of the flagged files</h2>
        <p>Uses the copying command to add the files that are in the flaggedList array to an HR Folder in the Documents directory.</p>

<h2>My Project Journey</h2>
<p>    The project aims to apply security principles that are applicable in the real world such as security within emails. This is important because companies need to monitor their information as well as the personal information of their employees.</p>
    <img src="Presfile1" alt="Code for Feature 3">
<p>Initially, I wanted to do a project that involved creating a website containing information about IT and Cybersecurity that I would learn from cybrary and ISC2</p>
    <img src="presFile2" alt="Code for Feature 3">
<p>However, I knew I needed to apply my knowledge as a working product that allows for the application of my new knowledge</p>
    <img src="presFile3" alt="Code for Feature 3">
<p>I decided I needed to contact my mentor for possible project ideas because of the extensive experience my mentor has in security with computers.</p>
<p>With my mentor's help I decided I wanted to write a script in Linux that could determine whether text files were duplicates of one another or not. I submitted this as my MVP(Minimum Viable Product)</p>
    <img src="presFile4" alt="Code for Feature 3">
<p>Later, I wanted to take my project to the next level because my MVP was my application of the commands I had learned throughout the entire semester.</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to ask my mentor on how I could apply my project more than just detecting duplicate text files and allowing users to delete the file and delete whichever version of the file they would like.</p>
<p>I added the feature of my project which is finalized to detect SSN's (Social Security Numbers) of employees in emails associated with the company</p>
    <img src="presFile5" alt="Code for Feature 3">
<p>Upon detection of a file it is flagged, the user is given the name of the file, and it is included at the end of the report and the script.</p>
