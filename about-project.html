<h2>My Project Journey</h2>
<p>The project aims to apply security principles that are applicable in the real world such as security within emails. This is important because companies need to monitor their information as well as the personal information of their employees.</p>
<p>Initially, I wanted to do a project that involved creating a website containing information about IT and Cybersecurity that I would learn from cybrary and ISC2</p>
<p>However, I knew I needed to apply my knowledge as a working product that </p>
<p>I decided I needed to contact my mentor for possible project ideas because of the extensive experience my mentor has in security with computers.</p>
<p>With my mentor's help I decided I wanted to write a script in Linux that could determine whether text files were duplicates of one another or not. I submitted this as my MVP(Minimum Viable Product)</p>
<p>Later, I wanted to take my project to the next level because my MVP was my application of the commands I had learned throughout the entire semester.</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to ask my mentor on how I could apply my project more than just detecting duplicate text files and allowing users to delete the file and delete whichever version of the file they would like.</p>
